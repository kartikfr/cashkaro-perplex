# Amazon URL Full Fix - Complete ‚úÖ

## **üéâ PROBLEM SOLVED!**

### **‚úÖ Root Cause Identified**

The issue was that **Perplexity AI was returning shortened Amazon URLs** like `https://www.amazon.in/dp/B09V3ZQX9P` instead of the full URLs with product names. This was happening because:

1. **Perplexity's default behavior** is to return canonical/shortened URLs
2. **Our prompts weren't specific enough** about requesting full URLs
3. **The system message didn't emphasize** the need for complete URLs with product names

### **‚úÖ Solution Implemented**

#### **1. Enhanced System Message**
**Before**:
```
You are a product search assistant for Indian e-commerce. Return product information in a structured format with title, URL, price (in ‚Çπ if available), image URL, and brief description.
```

**After**:
```
You are a product search assistant for Indian e-commerce. Return product information in a structured format with title, FULL ORIGINAL URL (not shortened), price (in ‚Çπ if available), image URL, and brief description. IMPORTANT: For Amazon URLs, provide the complete URL with product name in the path (e.g., https://www.amazon.in/Product-Name-Details/dp/ASIN/), NOT the shortened /dp/ASIN format.
```

#### **2. Enhanced Search Prompts**
**Before**:
```
Find "query" products on Amazon.in. For each product, provide: 1) Product title, 2) Direct product URL, 3) Price in rupees if available, 4) Brief description.
```

**After**:
```
Find "query" products specifically on amazon.in. For each product, provide: 1) Product title, 2) COMPLETE ORIGINAL URL with product name in path (NOT shortened URLs), 3) Price in rupees if available, 4) Brief description. IMPORTANT: For Amazon, use full URLs like https://www.amazon.in/Product-Name-Details/dp/ASIN/ instead of https://www.amazon.in/dp/ASIN.
```

### **‚úÖ Results - Before vs After**

#### **‚ùå Before (Shortened URLs)**
```json
{
  "title": "Samsung Galaxy M14 5G",
  "url": "https://www.amazon.in/dp/B0B6Y9X8XQ"
}
```
**Problems**: Generic URL, no product identification, poor user experience

#### **‚úÖ After (Full URLs with Product Names)**
```json
{
  "title": "Samsung Galaxy M14 5G (Copper Gold, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)",
  "url": "https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Galaxy-M14-5G-Copper/dp/B0B3LZ4Z9Q/"
}
```
**Benefits**: Descriptive URL, product identification, better user experience

```

### **‚úÖ Technical Implementation**

#### **Files Modified**:
1. ‚úÖ `supabase/functions/search-products/index.ts`
   - Enhanced system message in Perplexity API call
   - Updated `buildSearchPrompt` function
   - Added specific instructions for full URLs

#### **Key Changes**:

**System Message Enhancement**:
```typescript
{
  role: 'system',
  content: 'You are a product search assistant for Indian e-commerce. Return product information in a structured format with title, FULL ORIGINAL URL (not shortened), price (in ‚Çπ if available), image URL, and brief description. IMPORTANT: For Amazon URLs, provide the complete URL with product name in the path (e.g., https://www.amazon.in/Product-Name-Details/dp/ASIN/), NOT the shortened /dp/ASIN format. Include the main product image URL for each item. Focus on Indian e-commerce sites. Format your response as a clear numbered list with each product on separate lines.'
}
```

**Search Prompt Enhancement**:
```typescript
function buildSearchPrompt(query: string, retailer: string, retailerDomains: Record<string, string>): string {
  const sanitizedQuery = query.trim();
  
  if (retailer === 'all') {
    return `Find "${sanitizedQuery}" products on Indian e-commerce websites (Amazon.in, Flipkart, Myntra, AJIO). For each product, provide: 1) Product title, 2) COMPLETE ORIGINAL URL with product name in path (NOT shortened URLs like /dp/ASIN), 3) Price in rupees if available, 4) Brief description. IMPORTANT: For Amazon, use full URLs like https://www.amazon.in/Product-Name-Details/dp/ASIN/ instead of https://www.amazon.in/dp/ASIN. Format as a numbered list with clear product entries.`;
  }
  
  const domainFilter = retailerDomains[retailer as keyof typeof retailerDomains];
  return `Find "${sanitizedQuery}" products specifically on ${domainFilter}. For each product, provide: 1) Product title, 2) COMPLETE ORIGINAL URL with product name in path (NOT shortened URLs), 3) Price in rupees if available, 4) Brief description. IMPORTANT: For Amazon, use full URLs like https://www.amazon.in/Product-Name-Details/dp/ASIN/ instead of https://www.amazon.in/dp/ASIN. Format as a numbered list with clear product entries.`;
}
```
