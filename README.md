## Examples

### Example 1: Amazon Product

```bash
python product_image_extractor.py "https://amazon.in/dp/B08X123456" --output amazon_product.json
```

  "retailer": "amazon",
  "price": "‚Çπ1,34,900",
  "description": "Latest A17 Pro chip with titanium design...",
  "image_urls": [
    "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/P/B08X123456.01.L.jpg",
    "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/P/B08X123456.02.L.jpg"
  ],
  "extraction_time": "2024-01-15 14:30:25"
}
```

### Example 2: Flipkart Product

```bash
python product_image_extractor.py "https://flipkart.com/product/xyz" --verbose
```

### Example 3: Myntra Product

```bash
python product_image_extractor.py "https://myntra.com/item/abc" --output myntra_product.json
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No images found**
   - Check if the URL is valid and accessible
   - Verify the product page structure hasn't changed
   - Try with `--verbose` flag for detailed logging

2. **Rate limiting errors**
   - Increase the delay between requests
   - Use fewer concurrent requests
   - Check if the website has anti-bot measures

3. **Import errors**
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Check Python version (3.8+ required)

4. **Permission errors**
   - Ensure write permissions for output directory
   - Check file system permissions

### Debug Mode

```bash
# Enable debug logging
python product_image_extractor.py "URL" --verbose

# Check log file
tail -f image_extractor.log
```
